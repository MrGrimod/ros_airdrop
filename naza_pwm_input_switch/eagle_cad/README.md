# ROS AirDrop - PWM input switch 

The PCB is designed to act as an switch, to switch between the Raspberry Pi(or PWM Driver board) or the receiver as input source for the Naza-flight-controller.
In other words, it's ensuring that I can switch all the time, independently from the autonomous system(Raspberry Pi), to the 
receiver as input source for the flight controller, to take over controll myself, and the other way around.
